# CRUD Implementation for User Management API

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the CRUD operations as specified in the `promptContext.txt` file:

1. ✅ **CREATE A NEW USER**
2. ✅ **GET USER BY ID**
3. ✅ **UPDATE USER'S AGE**
4. ✅ **DELETE USER BY ID**

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
Added new DTOs in `User.kt`:
- `CreateUserRequest`: For creating new users with validation
- `UpdateUserAgeRequest`: For updating user age
- `UserResponse`: Simplified response format

### 2. Service Layer (`UserService.kt`)
Extended the service with the following methods:

#### CREATE USER
```kotlin
fun createUser(request: CreateUserRequest): User
```
- Generates unique IDs using AtomicInteger
- Provides default values for optional fields
- Maintains in-memory storage for demonstration

#### GET USER BY ID
```kotlin
fun getUserById(id: Int): User?
```
- Searches users by ID
- Returns null if user not found

#### UPDATE USER'S AGE
```kotlin
fun updateUserAge(id: Int, newAge: Int): User?
```
- Finds user by ID and updates age
- Returns updated user or null if not found

#### DELETE USER
```kotlin
fun deleteUser(id: Int): Boolean
```
- Removes user from collection
- Returns true if deleted, false if not found

### 3. Controller Layer (`UserController.kt`)
Added REST endpoints with proper HTTP methods and status codes:

#### GET /api/users/{id}
- Returns specific user by ID
- Status: 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found)

#### POST /api/users
- Creates new user from request body
- Status: 201 (Created) or 400 (Bad Request)

#### PATCH /api/users/{id}/age
- Updates user's age
- Status: 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found)

#### DELETE /api/users/{id}
- Deletes user by ID
- Status: 204 (No Content) or 404 (Not Found)

## API Documentation
All endpoints are documented with Swagger/OpenAPI annotations including:
- Operation summaries and descriptions
- Parameter descriptions
- Response codes and meanings
- Request/response examples

## Usage Examples

### 1. Create a New User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "gender": "male",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "phone": "+1-555-123-4567",
    "username": "johndoe",
    "password": "securepass",
    "birthDate": "1994-01-15"
  }'
```

### 2. Get User by ID
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users/1
```

### 3. Update User's Age
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/users/1/age \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"age": 31}'
```

### 4. Delete User
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/users/1
```

## Key Features

### Error Handling
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Try-catch blocks for exception handling
- Meaningful error responses

### Data Validation
- Required field validation
- Type safety with Kotlin data classes
- Input validation with @Valid annotation

### Thread Safety
- AtomicInteger for ID generation
- Concurrent access considerations

### RESTful Design
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Resource-based URLs
- Standard HTTP status codes

### Documentation
- Comprehensive Swagger annotations
- Clear API documentation
- Parameter and response descriptions

## In-Memory Storage Note
The current implementation uses in-memory storage for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, this would typically be replaced with:
- Database persistence (JPA/Hibernate)
- Data validation constraints
- Transaction management
- Audit logging
- Security measures

## Testing
The implementation includes proper error handling and can be tested with:
- Unit tests for service methods
- Integration tests for controllers
- API testing with tools like Postman or curl

All CRUD operations have been successfully implemented according to the specifications in `promptContext.txt`.
